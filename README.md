## Project Description   

The project will allow you to solidify your proficiency in C# and ASP.NET Core. As you design your web application, you will get a practical experience of creating domain models, developing unit tests, and implementing a user interface and the presentation layer using .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. When you complete this project, you will have a working web application showpiece to include in your portfolio.

The goal of the project is to create a To Do List web application that allows users to manage their personal activities by creating to do lists. The web application should work correctly on a desktop computer and a mobile phone. You may use the domain model from the Week #10 assignment as a starting point for your design. However, this application should be more functional. 

You are encouraged to check out [this application](https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app?rtc=1 ) as an example in order to get a general understanding of the desired result. However, please do not copy the design of the Microsoft application. Try to create your own design and functionality.
